EEM fab_detect script working process:

1. Script waits for the following message:

sysmgr.*sfe_drvr.*abnormally terminated.*restart scheduled

2. Once the above syslog message is detected the script is triggered.
3. At the beginning of the script the script verifies the following eem
   environment variables are set:

_storage_location
_output_log

4. The script next opens the script output logging file and timestamps the beginning of the log file:

$_storage_location/$_output_log

5. Opens a cli connection to the router.
6. Extracts the full syslog message and parses out the fabric card attribute.
7. Writes this information to the output log file.
8. Enters XR admin mode and captures the 'show controllers fabric plane all' output and writes this
   information to the output log file.  The script also parses this output for any currently down
   fabric cards.
9. Next the script verifies if the $fab_detect_run_flag file exists.  If the file exists the script
   logs this outcome to the output log file, generates a syslog message and exits.  If the run_flag
   file does not exist the script continues.
10. If the run_flag file does not exist the script creates the run_flag file and places a timestamp
    within the file.
11. As long as the run_flag file did not previously exist the script enters admin configure terminal
    and proceeds with the fabric card shutdown:

admin
config t
hw-mod shut loc <fabric location>
commit
end

12. Currently disabled, the script at this point would craft up the generated email message.
13. Updates the output log file with the actions taken and closes the file.
14. Generates a syslog message indicating the fabric card shutdown.
